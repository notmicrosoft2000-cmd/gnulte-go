// Package tui is the small pure-ANSI terminal kit used by the GNULTE tools:
// flicker-free dashboard frames on the alternate screen buffer, a raw-mode
// interactive screen for editors/wizards, and signal-safe terminal cleanup.
// It has no external dependencies and degrades to plain output when piped.
